# Global-COVID-Vaccine-Tracker

## Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected people's lives all around the world. As the world began to fight back, one of the most important steps was the development of vaccines. Vaccines offer protection against the virus and reduce the spread of the disease. However, keeping track of vaccination progress across the world can be difficult. That's why I have created the Global COVID Vaccine Tracker.

## Project Goals

The goal of my project is to create a user-friendly and informative dashboard that tracks COVID-19 vaccination progress across the world. The dashboard displays data on the number of vaccine doses administered, the number of people who have received at least one dose, and the percentage of the population that is fully vaccinated.
