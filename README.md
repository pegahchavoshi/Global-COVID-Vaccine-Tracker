# Global-COVID-Vaccine-Tracker

## Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected people's lives all around the world. As the world began to fight back, one of the most important steps was the development of vaccines. Vaccines offer protection against the virus and reduce the spread of the disease. However, keeping track of vaccination progress across the world can be difficult. That's why I have created the Global COVID Vaccine Tracker.

## Project Goals

The goal of my project is to create a user-friendly and informative dashboard that tracks COVID-19 vaccination progress across the world. The dashboard displays data on the number of vaccine doses administered, the number of people who have received at least one dose, and the percentage of the population that is fully vaccinated.

## Data Source

The dashboard gathers data from official sources, including governments and health ministries worldwide. The data is updated on a daily basis, with the latest update available 19 hours ago. The population estimates for per-capita metrics are based on the United Nations World Population Prospects, while the income groups are based on the World Bank classification.

## Dashboard Features

The Global COVID Vaccine Tracker dashboard is divided into several sections, each providing different metrics and visualizations to aid in understanding the current state of COVID-19 vaccination progress around the world. Some of the key features of the dashboard include:

Interactive world map: Provides an overview of the vaccination status in different countries, color-coded based on the percentage of the population that has received at least one dose of the vaccine.

Overview charts: Presents global vaccination metrics, such as the total number of vaccine doses administered and the number of doses administered daily.




Country-specific metrics: Allows users to explore vaccination progress in individual countries, with information on the percentage of the population vaccinated, the number of doses administered, and the type of vaccine used.
Vaccination policies: Provides information on the vaccination policies in different countries, including the eligibility criteria and vaccine availability.
Frequently asked questions: Answers to common questions about COVID-19 vaccines, such as their safety and efficacy, are also included in the dashboard.##
