### Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted every corner of the world, with millions of people affected and lives lost. The development and distribution of vaccines have been crucial in the fight against the virus. However, keeping track of vaccination progress across the globe can be a challenging task, with different countries following different protocols and reporting methods. The Global COVID Vaccine Tracker aims to simplify the process by providing an easy-to-use, informative dashboard that tracks COVID-19 vaccination progress across the world.

### Project Goals

The primary objective of this project is to create an interactive dashboard that presents real-time data on COVID-19 vaccination progress around the world. The dashboard aims to be user-friendly, visually appealing, and informative, providing users with an overview of vaccination efforts globally. Some specific goals for the project include:

* Gathering reliable, up-to-date data on vaccine distribution and administration from official sources such as governments and health ministries worldwide.
* Creating an intuitive, interactive interface that allows users to explore vaccination progress across different regions, countries, and demographic groups.
* Visualizing vaccination data in charts, graphs, and maps to facilitate easier comprehension and analysis.
* Providing users with context by including information on vaccination policies, eligibility criteria, and vaccine availability in different countries.
* Educating users on the importance of vaccination and answering frequently asked questions about COVID-19 vaccines.

### Data Source

The dashboard gathers data from official sources, including governments and health ministries worldwide. The data will be updated regularly, with the latest information on vaccine administration and distribution made available on a daily basis. The population estimates for per-capita metrics are based on the United Nations World Population Prospects, while the income groups are based on the World Bank classification.


### Dashboard Features

The Global COVID Vaccine Tracker dashboard is divided into several sections, each providing different metrics and visualizations to aid in understanding the current state of COVID-19 vaccination progress around the world. Some of the key features of the dashboard include:

Interactive world map: Provides an overview of the vaccination status in different countries, color-coded based on the percentage of the population that has received at least one dose of the vaccine.
